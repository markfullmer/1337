<h3>Chapter 1: Escape the Room</h3>
"Did you see more glass?" said Sybil.<br />

Mrs. Carpenter sighed. "All right," she said. She replaced the cap on the sun-tan oil bottle. "Now run and play, pussy. Mommy's going up to the hotel and have a Martini with Mrs. Hubbel. I'll bring you the olive."<br />

Set loose, Sybil immediately ran down to the flat part of the beach and began to walk in the direction of Fisherman's Pavilion. Stopping only to sink a foot in a soggy, collapsed castle, she was soon out of the area reserved for guests of the hotel.<br />

She walked for about a quarter of a mile and then suddenly broke into an oblique run up the soft part of the beach. She stopped short when she reached the place where a young man was lying on his back.<br />

"Are you going in the water, see more glass?" she said.<br />

The young man started, his right hand going to the lapels of his terry-cloth robe. He turned over on his stomach, letting a sausaged towel fall away from his eyes, and squinted up at Sybil.<br />

"Hey. Hello, Sybil."<br />

"Are you going in the water?"<br />

"I was waiting for you," said the young man. "What's new?"<br />

"What?" said Sybil.<br />

"What's new? What's on the program?"<br />

"My daddy's coming tomorrow on a nairiplane," Sybil said, kicking sand.<br />

"Not in my face, baby," the young man said, putting his hand on Sybil's ankle. "Well, it's about time he got here, your daddy. I've been expecting him hourly. Hourly."<br />
