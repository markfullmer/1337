Mrs. Carpenter sighed. "All right," she said. She replaced the cap on the sun-tan oil bottle. "Now run and play, pussy. Mommy's going up to the hotel and have a Martini with Mrs. Hubbel. I'll bring you the olive."<br />

Set loose, <?php echo "<fb:name uid=\"$friend\" linked=\"false\" firstnameonly=\"true\" />"; ?> immediately ran down to the flat part of the beach and began to walk in the direction of Fisherman's Pavilion.

"Hey. Hello, <?php echo "<fb:name uid=\"$friend\" linked=\"false\" firstnameonly=\"true\" />"; ?>."<br />

"Are you going in the water?"<br />

"I was waiting for you," said the young man. "What's new?"<br />

"What?" said <?php echo "<fb:name uid=\"$friend\" linked=\"false\" firstnameonly=\"true\" />"; ?>.<br />

"What's new? What's on the program?"<br />

"My daddy's coming tomorrow on a nairiplane," <?php echo "<fb:name uid=\"$friend\" linked=\"false\" firstnameonly=\"true\" />"; ?> said, kicking sand.<br />

"Not in my face, baby," the young man said, putting his hand on <?php echo "<fb:name uid=\"$friend\" linked=\"false\" firstnameonly=\"true\" />"; ?>'s ankle. "Well, it's about time he got here, your daddy. I've been expecting him hourly. Hourly."<br />
